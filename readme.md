Musium is an album-centered music player. It is designed to run as a daemon on
an always-on device connected to speakers. Playback can be controlled from
anywhere on the local network through a webinterface.

## Status

Musium is in a usable state, but many features are still missing. For example,
there is no way to pause playback yet. I used it on a daily basis, and I focus
on building the most valuable features first.
