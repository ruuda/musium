/// A memory-backed dictionary of album id to cover art thumbnail.
///
/// We want to store all thumbnails in memory to be able to serve them quickly.
/// Thumbnails are pretty small (ranging roughly from 5 kB to 20 kB, with some
/// outliers in either direction), even for a few thousand albums, this only
/// costs a few dozen megabytes of memory. Perhaps if you want serve a really
/// large collection from a really small device (e.g. 50k albums from a
/// Raspberry Pi model 1), then this is a problem. If that ever happens, we
/// could opt to make the data array file mmap-backed instead, but for now we
/// will just keep everything in memory.
///
/// The reason we want the thumbnails in memory, is that browsers regularly
/// evict them from the cache, so it has to sometimes re-request the thumbs when
/// scrolling through the album list, and especially in search, where
/// search-as-you-type and the discography for artist results can cause many
/// different thumbnails to be loaded in a very short time.
///
/// I run Musium with the thumbnails on an external disk, and this disk goes
/// into power saving mode after a while. Accessing the disk at that point can
/// incur something like a 15-second latency, as the disk has to spin up again.
/// So when you haven't used Musium for while and you open the webinterface and
/// start a search, if a thumbnail is not cached, that is going to cause a
/// request, which is going to take 15 seconds to load. And because browsers
/// only make 6-ish connections to the same host in parallel, once those
/// connections are used up for thumbs, the entire UI stalls, because the
/// browser queues new requests, even if the search requests could immediately
/// be served from memory. This was a real bad user experience, so therefore I
/// want to make sure that we can serve thumbnails without hitting the disk.
