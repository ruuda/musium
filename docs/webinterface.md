# Webinterface

The webinterface is the primary client for Musium. It is served from the
`listen` location [configured in the config file](configuration.md). The client
controls the Musium daemon through a <abbr>REST</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr>,
see also the [<abbr>API</abbr> reference](api.md).

The user interface should be straightforward to use. Browse the library, and
click or tap a track to enqueue it.

## Keyboard shortcuts

On desktop, the following keyboard shortcuts are supported:

 * **/** or **?** — Open the search panel.

## Use as mobile app

For an app-like experience, open the webinterface in a browser, and then use the
“add to home screen” feature to add Musium as an app.
