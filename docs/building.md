# Building

Musium is written in [Rust][rust] and [Purescript][purescript], so you need to
have the build tools for these available. An easy way to get them is through
[the Nix package manager][nix] (version â‰¥2.10 for flake support). The following
command enters a shell in which all of the required build tools are available:

    nix develop --command $SHELL

This environment is also tested on <abbr>CI</abbr>. Nix is a convenience, not
a requirement. You are free to source the build tools elsewhere, for example
from your system package repositories.

The webinterface is written in [Purescript][purescript]. There is a basic
makefile that calls `purs` and `psc-package`:

    make -C app
    stat app/output/app.js

The server will serve `app.js` and other static files alongside the
<abbr>API</abbr>. The server itself is written in [Rust][rust] and builds with
Cargo:

    cargo build --release

The binary can then be found in `target/release/musium`.

The Rust code for database interactions is generated by [Squiller][squiller]
from <abbr>SQL</abbr> files in `src`. The generated code is included in the
repository so no additional step is needed for normal builds, but if you change
the queries, regenerate the code:

    make -C src
